I keep all the common files in the 'common' directory. In order to build the
Windows version, you must first create copies of these files in the 'windows'
directory using the copy-files.bat script.

Note: the Plus42 workspace contains four projects: Plus42Binary, Plus42Decimal,
keymap2cpp, and skin2cpp. Before building Plus42Binary and Plus42Decimal, you
must build keymap2cpp and skin2cpp and run them; this creates the keymap.cpp
and skins.cpp files, which contain the default keymap and the skins to be
compiled into the Plus42 executable.

Starting with version 1.5.9, the Windows build of Plus42 builds the Intel
Floating-Point library from source. Run build-intel-lib.sh to build the
library; if successful, this will create a file named cl111libbid.lib,
containing x86 objects.
